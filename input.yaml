        ## Initial authorization token request

        This API call has no security; it is the basis of
        the bearer authentication. Security is provided by
        the use of secure http (https) and the remitter’s
        API credentials.

        `grant_type` is either `password`
        to get a new session token, or `refresh_token`
        to renew a session.

        The `refresh_token` is present only when the
        `grant_type` is `refresh_token`.

        # Link Bank Beneficiary

        Linking a bank beneficiary ***may*** require multiple steps.
        Different jurisdictions require different or additional
        pieces of information.
        The first step involves submitting five always-required pieces of
        information.


        ### Required Information:

        - Bank account number

        - Bank country code

        - Beneficiary country code

        - Beneficiary name

        - Currency

        ### Additional Jurisdiction Information

        In some cases, additional information may be requested by the bank to
        complete the linkage depending on its regulatory and compliance
        environment. In such cases, the initial
        response may return with a 200 code, and the
        `LinkBankBeneficiary:request:OperationStatus: Success`
        may be **`false`**.
        The `Error` field will have an `ErrorMessage`,
        and report that an additional `FieldName` and
        `FieldLabel` are required
        (possibly **`"RoutingNumber"`** and
        **`"Account Number"`**, respectively.

        The call is then made a second time, filling out the
        required field (in this example, the field
        `LinkBankBeneficiary:request:Beneficiary:BankDetails:RoutingNumber`).

        Unusual data will be specified as going into `RemittanceLine3`
        or `RemittanceLine4`.

        ### Exotic Currency Requirements

        Some currencies will require currency-specific information to remit funds.
        This follows the two-step process above, specifying what additional
        data items are required to complete the linkage.
